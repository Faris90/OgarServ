## Ogar vs Agar
There two versions here, one be Ogar Server and one be Agar Server. The difrance is how coordinates from server to client and back are send. Agar.io uses the agar server, while private websites that usually are on an older protocol need the Ogar Server. If you dont know your client try Agar first, if you in your client only basicly see one huge ball, it means you need Ogar.

## 32Bit vs 64Bit
No real diferance, 64Bit means a higher memory food print allowed by the server. But the Server should trutfully never exceed 1.4MB So should not really matter what one you use. We supply both, for those that seek to try 64Bit.
